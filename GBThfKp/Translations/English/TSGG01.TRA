@1 = ~Hey Boss!  Something big is going down.  You should talk to Lathan when you get the chance.~
@2 = ~Give 'em hell <CHARNAME>!  Them lousy guards have it coming.~
@3 = ~Heard about you taking care of those guards what have been giving us problems.  Right proud I am to work for ye boss, and that's the truth.~
@4 = ~Ah yes!  Turnip smuggling!  A very lucrative trade, that is.  My Uncle Scratchy was one of the fastest Turnip Runners (as we called them) from here to Thundertree.  He once made the Tuber Run in less than twelve leagues!~
@5 = ~Why, that's impossible!~
@6 = ~Not for my Uncle Scratchy, my good man.~
